    "1.A class is called an Abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and its abstract methods must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",

    "2.An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to right.\n",
